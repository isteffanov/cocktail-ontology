At a time when scurvy was rife on ships, this combination of gin and citrus 
juice was thought to cure the ailment. Scurvy is a vitamin C deficiency 
characterised by anaemia, fatigue, bruising and bleeding. When citrus juice 
was available, it was treated as a gift from the Gods, helping to bring 
those at the brink of exhaustion back to life in a relatively short time. 
The addition of gin was to lessen the sharp taste of the lime juice, and so 
the Gimlet was born, named after the doctor, Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Desmond
Gimlette.
