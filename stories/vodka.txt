Traditional vodka is made from two raw materials: water and ethanol 
from the fermentation of cereal grains (like wheat, sorghum, or rye).
Many vodka brands use other base ingredients (like potatoes and 
sugar beets) and additives (like botanicals and spices) to achieve 
distinctive character in their liquor. After fermenting and 
distilling, vodka undergoes a filtration and refining process to 
remove impurities and achieve a smooth mouthfeel.
