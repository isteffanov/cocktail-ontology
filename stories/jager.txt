JÃ¤germeister's ingredients include 56 herbs, fruits, roots, and 
spices, including citrus peel, licorice, anise, poppy seeds, 
saffron, ginger, juniper berries, and ginseng.[14] These ingredients
are ground, then steeped in water and alcohol for two to three days.
This mixture is filtered and stored in oak barrels for about a year.
Then the liqueur is filtered again, and mixed with sugar, caramel 
and alcohol.
