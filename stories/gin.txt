Gin is a type of spirit characterized by the flavor of juniper 
berries. Gin makers produce gin by infusing a neutral spirit with 
botanical ingredients during the distillation process. For liquor to
be classified as gin in the United States, it must contain at least 
40 percent alcohol by volume (ABV). There are many different types 
of gin, including Old Tom, Plymouth, Genever, and London Dry, and an
array of cocktails featuring the popular spirit, such as the classic
Gin and Tonic, Tom Collins, and the French 75.
